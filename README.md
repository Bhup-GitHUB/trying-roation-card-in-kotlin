## Features

- **Rotation Interaction:** Users can rotate the card horizontally or vertically to reveal additional content or perform actions.
- **Customizable Design:** Easily customize the design of the card, including colors, text, and animations.

- **Responsive Layout:** Ensure the UI is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations.
